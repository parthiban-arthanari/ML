To determine the values here, we make several assumptions. Currently, we are spending approximately $5k per team member per sprint, which totals $50k for one year. This is based on 24 sprints per year, with 2 sprints per month. We assume 20 lines of business (LOBs), each with 2 applications, and 2 developers working in each LOB. Currently, Wells Fargo is spending $5k on subscription charges for an existing BI tool, amounting to $60k per year.

In the first year, three developers will work to build Lumen.AI, costing around $150k in total with no immediate savings or revenue.

From the second year onwards, only two developers will work on the onboarding stage. We plan to migrate 10 apps to Lumen.AI, which allows us to reallocate 10 developers and save $500k in developer costs annually. This savings will continue each year.

Additionally, we will save $50k annually on the existing BI tool subscription.

We also see opportunities to generate revenue. We plan to charge $50k as a subscription fee for our product, generating $50k for each app. This results in $0.5 million in the first year, $1 million in the second year, $1.5 million in the third year, and $2 million in the fourth year.

Overall, by investing in Lumen.AI, we will generate $5 million in revenue over five years. A detailed look at the financial projections shows that we will reach the break-even point after one year, with revenue increasing significantly each subsequent year.

Similarly, we will save around $1.9 million over five years, achieving break-even in savings in one year, just like our revenue model.
